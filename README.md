## Prerequisite

This project uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
`gradlew build` command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

## App

The app loads the the movies from the api and displays them in a list. When the Movie is clicked the
app navigates to the Details Screen which shows more details.

## Architecture

The app is built using the Modular MVVM architectural pattern and makes heavy use of a couple of
Android Jetpack components. MVVM allows for the separation of concern which also makes testing
easier. The app has composable screen that communicates to ViewModel which in turn communicates to
the usecase which communicates with Repository to get data.
